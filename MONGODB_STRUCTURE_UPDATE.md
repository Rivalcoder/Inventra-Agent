# MongoDB Structure Update - Single Collections with User Isolation

## Problem with Previous Structure
The previous structure created separate collections for each user:
- `products_user_kkk_1757230565999`
- `sales_user_kkk_1757230565999`
- `settings_user_kkk_1757230565999`
- etc.

This was messy, inefficient, and caused database clutter.

## New Structure
Now we use **single collections** with a `userId` field for user isolation:

### Collections:
- `users` - Contains all user accounts
- `products` - All products with `userId` field
- `sales` - All sales with `userId` field  
- `settings` - All settings with `userId` field
- `customers` - All customers with `userId` field
- `suppliers` - All suppliers with `userId` field
- `categories` - All categories with `userId` field

### Indexes:
- `products`: `{ userId: 1, name: 1 }` (unique)
- `sales`: `{ userId: 1, productId: 1 }` and `{ userId: 1, saleDate: -1 }`
- `settings`: `{ userId: 1, setting_key: 1 }` (unique)
- `customers`: `{ userId: 1, email: 1 }` (unique)
- `suppliers`: `{ userId: 1, name: 1 }` (unique)
- `categories`: `{ userId: 1, name: 1 }` (unique)

## Benefits:
1. **Clean Database Structure** - Only 7 collections instead of 7 Ã— number of users
2. **Better Performance** - Single collections with proper indexes
3. **Easier Management** - No need to create/delete collections per user
4. **Scalable** - Can handle thousands of users efficiently
5. **Data Isolation** - Each user's data is still completely isolated via `userId` field

## How It Works:

### User Creation:
1. User signs up in cloud mode
2. System creates user in `users` collection with unique `userId`
3. Main collections are created if they don't exist
4. Indexes are created for user isolation
5. Dummy data is inserted with `userId` field

### Data Access:
1. All API calls include `userId` in headers
2. Database queries filter by `userId` field
3. Each user only sees their own data
4. Complete data isolation maintained

### Example Queries:
```javascript
// Get user's products
db.products.find({ userId: "user_kkk_1757230565999" })

// Get user's settings
db.settings.find({ userId: "user_kkk_1757230565999" })

// Create new product for user
db.products.insertOne({
  id: "product123",
  userId: "user_kkk_1757230565999",
  name: "Laptop",
  price: 999.99,
  // ... other fields
})
```

## Migration:
For existing users with old structure, you can:
1. Keep the old collections (they won't interfere)
2. Or migrate data from old collections to new structure
3. New users will automatically use the new structure

## Files Updated:
1. `app/api/db/create-cluster/route.ts` - Updated user creation logic
2. `app/api/db/route.ts` - Updated all database queries to use userId filtering
3. `app/auth/signup/page.tsx` - Already updated to work with new structure
4. `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Already updated to work with new structure

## Testing:
1. Create a new user account in cloud mode
2. Verify only main collections are created (no user-specific collections)
3. Add some inventory items
4. Create another user account
5. Verify complete data isolation between users
6. Check that each user only sees their own data
