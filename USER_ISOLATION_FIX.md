# User Isolation Fix for MongoDB Cloud Database

## Problem
When creating new users in the cloud database (MongoDB), the system was not creating individual inventory space for each user. Instead, it was using old user data and not allocating unique inventory space for each new user.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the signup flow:

1. **Signup Process**: The main `handleSignUp` function in `app/auth/signup/page.tsx` was only calling `airtableService.createUser(userData)` for cloud mode, which stored user data in localStorage but didn't create the actual MongoDB user or collections.

2. **Missing MongoDB Integration**: The system had a separate `handleCreateCluster` function that properly created MongoDB users with unique collections, but this was only called from the "Create Account in Cluster" button, not from the main signup flow.

3. **Authentication Issue**: The signin process was also using the Airtable service for cloud mode instead of authenticating against the actual MongoDB database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Signup Process (`app/auth/signup/page.tsx`)
- Updated `handleSignUp` function to call the MongoDB cluster creation API (`/api/db/create-cluster`) when in cloud mode (`authMode === 'airtable'`)
- This ensures that each new user gets:
  - A unique `userId` (format: `user_{username}_{timestamp}`)
  - User-specific collections: `products_{userId}`, `sales_{userId}`, `settings_{userId}`, etc.
  - Proper database configuration with the `userId` included

### 2. Created MongoDB Authentication API (`app/api/auth/mongodb-signin/route.ts`)
- New API endpoint for authenticating users against the MongoDB database
- Verifies user credentials and returns user data with `userId`
- Updates last login timestamp

### 3. Fixed Signin Process (`app/auth/signin/page.tsx`)
- Updated `handleSignIn` function to use the new MongoDB authentication API for cloud mode
- Ensures users are authenticated against the actual MongoDB database, not localStorage

### 4. User-Specific Collections
The system now creates the following collections for each user:
- `products_{userId}` - User's inventory products
- `sales_{userId}` - User's sales records
- `settings_{userId}` - User's settings
- `customers_{userId}` - User's customer data
- `suppliers_{userId}` - User's supplier data
- `categories_{userId}` - User's product categories

## How It Works Now

### For New Users (Cloud Mode):
1. User fills out signup form and selects "Cloud" mode
2. System calls `/api/db/create-cluster` API
3. API creates user in MongoDB with unique `userId`
4. API creates user-specific collections with proper indexes
5. User data is stored with `userId` for future reference
6. User can sign in and access their isolated inventory data

### For Existing Users (Cloud Mode):
1. User signs in with credentials
2. System calls `/api/auth/mongodb-signin` API
3. API authenticates against MongoDB database
4. Returns user data with `userId`
5. All subsequent API calls use user-specific collections

### Data Isolation:
- Each user's data is stored in collections with their unique `userId` suffix
- The `getUserCollectionName` function in the database service ensures proper collection naming
- The API client automatically includes `userId` in headers for all requests
- The database API routes use `getUserCollectionName` to access the correct collections

## Files Modified:
1. `app/auth/signup/page.tsx` - Fixed signup flow for cloud mode
2. `app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Fixed signin flow for cloud mode  
3. `app/api/auth/mongodb-signin/route.ts` - New MongoDB authentication API
4. `app/api/db/create-cluster/route.ts` - Already had proper user creation logic

## Testing:
To test the fix:
1. Create a new user account in Cloud mode
2. Add some inventory items
3. Create another user account in Cloud mode
4. Verify that the second user has an empty inventory (no data from first user)
5. Add different inventory items for the second user
6. Sign out and sign back in as the first user
7. Verify that the first user still sees only their original data

## Benefits:
- ✅ Each user has completely isolated inventory data
- ✅ No data leakage between users
- ✅ Scalable solution that works with multiple users
- ✅ Proper user authentication against MongoDB
- ✅ Unique user identification with `userId`
- ✅ User-specific collections with proper indexing
